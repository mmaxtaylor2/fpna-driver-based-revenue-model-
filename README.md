# fpna-driver-based-revenue-model-
Python-based FP&amp;A project combining a driver-based SaaS revenue model with automated monthly actual vs budget variance analysis and dashboard-ready outputs. 

----

## Project Overview 

The goal of this project was to move beyond top-down forecasting and build financial models based on underlying business drivers. The project integrates Python-based analysis with spreadsheet-based dashboards to mirror how FP&A teams operate in practice. 

---

## Key Components 

### 1. Driver-Based Revenue Model 
- Modeled SaaS revenue using business drivers rather than static growth assumptions
- Focused on understanding how changes in customers, pricing, and expansion impact revenue
- Desinged to support sensitivity analysis and strategic decison-making 

### 2. Monthly Variance Analysis Engine 
- Built a Python-based engine to compare actuals vs budget
- Calculated dollar and percentage variances 
- Applied favorable / unfavorable logic based on FP&A conventions 
- Exported dashboard-ready outputs for visualizations 

---

## Dashboards & Outputs

The outputs from the Python models are visualzied using Google Sheets 

---

## Tools & Technolgies 
- Python (pandas) 
- Google Sheets (pivot tables and charts) 
- VS Code 
- GitHub 

## Key Takeaways 

- Driver-based models provide more insight than top-down forecasts 
- Variance analysis is most efffective when paired with clear visuals
- Automating FP&A workflows consistency and scalability 

## Related Finanical Modeling Work 
- In addition to the variance analysis workflow shown here, this project was informed by a broader SaaS operating model built in Google Sheets. The model incorporates headcount planning, payroll and non-payroll operating expenses, and driver-based subscription revenue assumptions to support forward looking FP&A analysis.
